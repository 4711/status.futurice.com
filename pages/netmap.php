<h2>Network map</h2>
<div class="row">
<div class="span9">
This map shows status of various networks at Futurice. Not all details and backup connections are included. Also, this map is not always up-to-date - if <a href="?page=services">services page</a> says something is up and this indicates it's down, most probably it's in fact up.
